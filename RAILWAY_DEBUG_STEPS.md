# RAILWAY DEBUGGING STEPS

## Current Status
- ✅ Backend builds successfully  
- ✅ Backend starts and listens on 0.0.0.0:8080
- ❌ Railway edge can't reach the backend

## Check These Settings in Railway:

### 1. Settings → Networking
- **Target Port**: Should be `8080`
- **Domain**: Should show your domain
- **Public networking**: Should be enabled

### 2. Settings → Deploy  
- **Start Command**: Should be `./out`
- **Healthcheck Path**: Should be `/health`

### 3. Variables Tab
- Add: `PORT = 8080`

### 4. Try This
1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Click restart on latest deployment
3. Wait 2 minutes
4. Test: https://persona-frontend-production-4c8b.up.railway.app/health

## Alternative: Quick Test
Create new Railway service:
1. New service from template
2. Choose "Blank Service"  
3. Connect to your GitHub repo
4. Set root directory to `railway-backend`
5. Deploy

This will create a fresh service that might work better.
